Introduction to PHP magic methods

PHP magic methods are special methods in a class.
The magic methods override the default actions when the object performs the actions.

By convention, the names of magic methods start with a double underscore (__).
And PHP reserves the methods whose names start with a double underscore (__) for magic methods.
